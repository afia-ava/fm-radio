## Features:
1. Using STC15W chip as the main control chip and RDA5807S radio module, it has the effect of 87-108MHz global FM receiving frequency band compatibility
2. It has the advantages of noise cancellation, soft mute, bass enhancement, high sensitivity, low noise, and strong anti-interference ability
3. The power amplifier part adopts TDA2822 power amplifier integrated circuit, which has the characteristics of simple circuit, good sound quality, and wide voltage range
4. Supports dual power supply (USB 5V power supply or 2 No. 5 batteries)
5. Easy to use, high sensitivity antenna automatically searches for channels

It's mostly a soldering practice project for me, and I'll be putting updates as I work through it in the Journal folder!
